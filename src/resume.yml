      Refactored in-house packet generation software to allow configurable
      bursty traffic patterns, of up to 100Gbps, using a custom memory allocator,
      improving performance by up to 60% over existing in-house packet generator.

      Patched open source packet generation engine to support Netronome’s network
      card drivers and in-house traffic pattern generator, allowing the full
      performance of the Netronome network cards to be tested using open source
      testing software.
